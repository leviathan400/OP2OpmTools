## What is it?

Open OP2MissionEditor .opm json file and convert to C++ code

The OP2MissionEditor is very good for object placement (vehicles, buildings and beacons). We can use it to setup our objects for our Outpost 2 dll mission. We can then use OP2OpmTools to convert the object placement data from the .opm file to C++ code to paste into out Outpost 2 dll project.

The [OP2MissionEditor](https://github.com/TechCor8/OP2MissionEditor) saves its mission's in a json file format with .opm file extension. 

Also can export a report of the contents of the .opm.

## Sample Output
Here's an example of the C++ code generated from an .opm file:

```cpp
// Generated by OP2OpmTools
Export int InitProc()
{
    // Player 0 (Blue)
    Player[0].GoPlymouth();
    Player[0].SetColorNumber(0);
    
    Unit x;
    
    // Create units
    // CargoTruck at position 13, 8, facing East
    TethysGame::CreateUnit(x, mapCargoTruck, LOCATION(13 + 31, 8 - 1), 0, mapNone, 0);
    x.DoSetLights(1);
    
    // Tiger Microwave at position 13, 11, facing East
    TethysGame::CreateUnit(x, mapTiger, LOCATION(13 + 31, 11 - 1), 0, mapMicrowave, 0);
    x.DoSetLights(1);
    
    // Panther Supernova at position 19, 11, facing West
    TethysGame::CreateUnit(x, mapPanther, LOCATION(19 + 31, 11 - 1), 0, mapSupernova, 4);
    x.DoSetLights(1);
    
    // CommandCenter at position 97, 35
    TethysGame::CreateUnit(x, mapCommandCenter, LOCATION(97 + 31, 35 - 1), 0, mapNone, 0);
    
    // Agridome at position 104, 35
    TethysGame::CreateUnit(x, mapAgridome, LOCATION(104 + 31, 35 - 1), 0, mapNone, 0);
    
    // Create walls and tubes
    CreateTubeOrWallLine(100 + 31, 35 - 1, 101 + 31, 35 - 1, mapTube);
    TethysGame::CreateWallOrTube(102 + 31, 35 - 1, 0, mapTube);
    
    return 1; // return 1 if OK; 0 on failure
}
```

The generated code is ready to paste directly into your Outpost 2 mission project and will recreate all the units, buildings, walls, tubes, and beacons that were placed in the OP2MissionEditor.
