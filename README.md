## What is it?

Open OP2MissionEditor .opm json file and convert to C++ code

The OP2MissionEditor (https://github.com/TechCor8/OP2MissionEditor) saves its mission's in a json file format with .opm file extension. 

The OP2MissionEditor is very good for object placement (vehicles, buildings and beacons). We can use it to setup our objects for our Outpost 2 dll mission. We can then use OP2OpmTools to convert the object placement data from the .opm file to C++ code to paste into out Outpost 2 dll project.
